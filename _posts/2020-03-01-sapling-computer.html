<p><b>Sapling</b> - A mini-ITX sized computer case concept that focuses on performance and aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Traditional desktop computers are often large and heavy, housed in uninviting cases. The desktop computers are however not going away. They are just changing to a smaller form factor while getting more performant.</p>

<p>My mission was to design a no compromise small mini-ITX sized computer case that could house the processing power of a traditional desktop workstation with sufficient cooling capacity that utilizes standard components and would still be effortless to build.</p>

<h2>Material selection</h2>
<p>The frame is made of rigid, precision machined 2,5mm thick aluminum and high quality hardwood.</p>

<h2>Design details</h2>
<p>The Sapling supports custom water cooling. The case is designed to fit a 240mm radiator and a 120mm radiator which brings the total cooling area up to 360mm. The wooden front grille and the side panel holes allow for cool air to enter the case and the hot air can exhaust from the top.</p>

<p>The holes in the side panels can also be used for mounting SSDs and other components.</p>

<p>The Sapling can easily be placed on top of even a small desk due to its compact size. The vertical form factor is designed to take as little surface area of the desk as possible. It is easy to move when needed and the connections are well accessible from the back. It even allows for better cable management.</p>

<p>The Sapling is modular which makes the case effortless to build. Both side panels can be removed to get an easy access to the components. The top radiator is connected to the top panel which can be removed easily with two screws after the side panels are removed.</p>

<p>The water loop is designed to be used without a reservoir and can be filled from the top radiator. When connected to soft tubing it can be slightly moved around which helps with maintenance.</p>
