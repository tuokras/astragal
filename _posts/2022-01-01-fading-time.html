<h2>Product description</h2>
<p>Fading time is an e-paper wristwatch concept. It suits as a modern alternative to mechanical watches since it has a customizable non-backlit home screen with digital numbers but retains the minimalism of conventional timepieces. The display has to be updated only periodically which allows for a long battery life. The symmetrical frame sits naturally on both wrists.</p>

<p>The name comes from the screen technology since the pixels fade from one color to another. The watch supports wireless charging through the front glass.</p>
