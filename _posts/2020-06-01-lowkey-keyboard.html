<h2>Device description</h2>
<p>Lowkey is a low-profile wireless keyboard concept that houses a built in battery and mechanical switches. It strives for better ergonomics than a regular full-size keyboard with smaller frame size and lower height. Despite the lower height it houses mechanical switches for precise typing. The integrated lithium-ion battery guarantees a long battery life for wireless connection and can be charged with an USB-C cable.</p>

<p>The keyboard has multiple color options and three different switch types to choose from: the tactile brown, linear red and clicky blue. The function keys can be accessed by holding down the fn-button and pressing the corresponding number key.</p>

<p>The top frame is made from slightly textured ABS, the injection molded keycaps are PBT and the stiff bottom plate is milled aluminium alloy 6061. In between are sandwiched the FR4 PCB, the switches, and the battery.</p>
